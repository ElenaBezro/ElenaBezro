- 👋 Hi, I’m Elena. My [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elena-bezrodnova-0520561ba/)
- 👀 I’m interested in web development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and Spring Boot

- My projects:

  -  **In process...**    [E-Commerce Shop REST API](https://github.com/ElenaBezro/E-CommerceShopRESTfulAPI/tree/main)

  - [RSLang](https://rslang-monorepo-client.vercel.app/)

      Two-person team project for learning English, which includes two mini-games and a dictionary with the ability to monitor progress.

      _React, Redux, Typescript, Material UI, JSON_
    
      **Due to the 'cold start' nature of the Vercel platform, the startup time for the backend part of the app is approximately 10 minutes. Thank you for your understanding.**

  - [Project Management App](https://manage-app-team32.netlify.app/)

    [Demo: Create/update/delete columns and tasks. Drag&drop](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73139136/171032121-a1b62e12-8422-423d-a2c0-33a3ee635247.gif)
