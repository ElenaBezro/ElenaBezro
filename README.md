Two-person team project for learning English, which includes two mini-games and a dictionary with the ability to monitor progress.

React, Redux, Typescript, Material UI, JSON 
(**Due to the 'cold start' nature of the Vercel platform, the startup time for the backend part of the app is approximately 10 minutes. Thank you for your understanding.**
